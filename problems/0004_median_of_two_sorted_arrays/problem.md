# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

**LeetCode #4** | Difficulty: Hard

## Problem

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n`, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m + n <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6`
